MidiOSC : (C) 2016 Jonny Stutters : jstutters@jeremah.co.uk : jeremah.co.uk

MidiOSC is a small program to bridge the worlds of MIDI and OSC by providing
bidirectional conversion of MIDI to OSC.  Released under the GPLv2 license.


Building MidiOSC
================

MidiOSC is not currently distributed as a binary for any platform so you will
need to build it from source.  MidiOSC is known to build successfully on OSX
10.5-10.11 and Ubuntu 9.10.

Dependencies
------------

MidiOSC depends on the liblo OSC library (liblo.sourceforge.net).  Liblo is
available through the packaging system of many Linux distributions and is known
to compile on OSX.  Before attempting to compile MidiOSC you should ensure that
the liblo library and headers are in the appropriate location for your system
(/usr/lib and /usr/include usually)

Compiling
---------

Unpack the MidiOSC sourcecode the in a terminal change to the newly created
directory.  Run the command "scons".  If compilation is successful you should
see "scons: done building targets." in the output.

Installation
------------

MidiOSC does not need to be installed, for easy access you may prefer to move
the midiosc binary to somewhere in your systems path (e.g. /usr/local/bin).


Using MidiOSC
=============

Starting up
-----------

Start MidiOSC by typing "midiosc" (assuming the MidiOSC binary is somewhere in
your path).  You will be asked to select the MIDI ports that you want to open
for input and output (for multiple ports enter a space separated list).  After
the ports have been selected MidiOSC will begin to listen for MIDI and OSC
input.  The IP addresses and ports can be changed when starting MidiOSC, enter
"midiosc --help" for more details.  By default MidiOSC sends to localhost:8000
and listens on port 7001.

Example
-------

An example Python program is included with MidiOSC, see example.py.

MIDI input
----------

When MidiOSC receives MIDI input it will generate an OSC message with the address:
/midi/[Device name]/[Channel]

Note that:
- the channel will be omitted from global MIDI messages (e.g. timing pulses)
- any spaces in the device name will be replaced by underscores

The OSC message will have the a string argument indicating the type of MIDI
message (e.g. note on, control change) and a number of integer arguments
appropriate to the type of MIDI message (e.g. note number and velocity for a
note on message).  See the tables below to see the message type strings used
and the number of integer arguments that will be generated.

MIDI output
-----------

To generate a MIDI message, send MidiOSC an OSC message.  MidiOSC expects input
of the same type of OSC messages that it sends.  At the moment MidiOSC is not
strict about input parameters, users should ensure that they provide
appropriate types of data (e.g. a note on message should have two integer
arguments in addition to the message type argument.  MidiOSC does not currently
support output of sysex MMC messages.
